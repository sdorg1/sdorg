Aspose.Email for Java, MS Outlook document management library.
==========================================================================

Aspose.Email for Java is a collection of components for working with a number of email message formats and message
storage files (PST/OST) along with message sending and receiving capabilities. Aspose.Email makes it easy to create,
read and manipulate a number of message formats such as MSG, EML, EMLX and MHT files without the need of installing
Microsoft Outlook. You can not only change the message contents, but also manipulate (add, extract and remove)
attachments from a message object. You can customize message headers by adding or removing recipients, changing the
subject or other properties. It also gives you complete control over an email message by providing access to its Mapi
properties. Aspose.Email not only supports manipulating message files, but also enables you to manage message storage
files i.e. Personal Storage Files (PST) and Offline Storage Files (OST). You can create PST files and add messages to
them in no time. With its well-structured API, Aspose.Email gives you complete access to a PST fileâ€™s folders,
sub-folders and messages for reading and extraction. Through its iCalendar component, Aspose.Email provides you
the capability to create and save Outlook Calendar objects in various formats such as MSG and ICS. Not only you can
create and save these, but you can send, retrieve, update and cancel meeting requests through message sending protocols
mentioned earlier. When it comes to sending/retrieving emails, Aspose.Email empowers you to work it out using SMTP,
POP3, IMAP and Microsoft Exchange Servers. Hence, you can access your email account for required functionality with
appropriate option of your choice.
Aspose.Email for Java allows developers to focus on implementing their business logic and managing emails without
having to get into the nitty-gritty of email and network programming. Our file format expertise ensures that
the components are easy to use and give you the controls you need to perform your tasks.
